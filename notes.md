**lesson 1: getting started**

- testing frameworks consist of tools for test creation and execution
- popular testing frameworks: jest, vitest, and mocha
- vitest is favored for its ecmascript modules and ts support
- react testing library is recommended for testing react components (provides a user-centric approach to testing)
- jsdom is a tool used to simulate a web browser in a node.js environment and facilitates the writing/execution of web application tests
- happydom is an alternative to jsdom (offers faster performance, but lacks some browser apis)
- @testing-library/jest-dom is a node package that includes matchers for writing assertions
